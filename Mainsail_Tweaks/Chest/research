Of course! You can definitely organize that list of macros into clean, logical groups. Mainsail has a great feature for this that lets you create separate sections for your macros right from the user interface.

Here’s how to do it:

1. Enable Expert Mode for Macros

First, you need to switch Mainsail's macro display from "Simple" to "Expert" mode.

    In the Mainsail interface, click the Settings icon (the gear ⚙️) in the top right menu.

    In the menu on the left, go to the Macros section.

    Change the Mode from "Simple" to "Expert."

2. Create Your Macro Groups

Once in Expert Mode, you'll see a new "Create Group" button. You can create groups that will act as headings for your macros. Based on your current macros, I suggest the following groups:

    Print Lifecycle

    Filament

    Calibration

    Diagnostics & Utilities

Click "Create Group" for each of these and give them a name.

3. Add Macros to Your New Groups

After creating the groups, you can add your macros to them:

    Click the pencil icon ✏️ next to a group to edit it.

    From the "Available Macros" list, select the macros that belong in that group.

Here is a recommended way to sort your current macros:

    Print Lifecycle Group

        PRINT START

        PRINT END

        SET PAUSE AT LAYER

        SET PAUSE NEXT LAYER

    Filament Group

        FILAMENT CHANGE M600

        FILAMENT LOAD

        FILAMENT UNLOAD

    Calibration Group

        G29

        VORON PURGE

        LOAD PID PROFILE

        SAVE PID TO PROFILE

    Diagnostics & Utilities Group

        CLEAN PRINTER CFG

        DIAGS BED HEATSOAK

        DIAGS TEST SPEED

Once you save your changes, your Mainsail dashboard will update with a much cleaner, organized layout for your macros.
